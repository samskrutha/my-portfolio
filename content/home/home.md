    description="Based in Berlin, I specialize in building scalable, secure, and observable cloud-native platforms. I’ve led DevOps transformations in health-tech and enterprise environments, empowering teams with infrastructure-as-code, GitOps, and production-grade Kubernetes systems.<br/><br/>With over a decade of experience — including six years as a backend developer — I bring a product-minded, automation-first approach to platform engineering. From Terraform to Crossplane, from GitLab CI/CD to ArgoCD, I design systems that developers love and operations teams trust.<br/><br/>Whether mentoring engineers or optimizing cloud costs, I care deeply about building platforms that balance speed, reliability, and simplicity.<br/><br/>Welcome to my digital home — where I write about DevOps, developer productivity, and building a meaningful, well-balanced life."
