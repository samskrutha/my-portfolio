## Senior Software Engineer

This role marked the foundation of my professional growth in software engineering. During my tenure at HCL Global Systems Inc., I worked on full-stack development for enterprise applications, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams across design, QA, and infrastructure.

I was responsible for building and maintaining core modules for web-based systems used by Fortune 500 clients, ensuring high availability and performance. My time at HCL also gave me exposure to version control workflows, RESTful API integration, and real-world agile methodologies, which shaped my collaborative and structured approach to development.

One of my key contributions was the development of an internal documentation and knowledge-sharing platform, which improved onboarding and cross-team communication. I also built automated testing scripts that reduced QA cycles by 25%, boosting overall release efficiency.

Beyond my technical contributions, I actively mentored junior developers and participated in regular code reviews, cultivating a strong culture of continuous improvement and technical ownership.

This role laid the groundwork for my transition from backend development into platform engineering, setting the stage for my future specialization in DevOps and infrastructure automation.
