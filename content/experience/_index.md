With over 11 years of professional experience in the IT industry — including 6 years as a backend developer and the last 5+ years specializing in DevOps and Platform Engineering — I’ve built a career around automating infrastructure, enabling developer velocity, and architecting cloud-native systems.

My expertise spans cloud platforms like **GCP** and **AWS**, container orchestration with **Kubernetes**, GitOps tooling (**ArgoCD**, **Helm**), infrastructure-as-code (**Terraform**, **Crossplane**), and secure CI/CD pipelines using **GitLab CI**.

I’ve worked in healthcare, retail, and product-based environments — from large enterprises to startups — always with a focus on **automation, reliability, observability, and cost-effective scaling**.

Each role listed here represents a critical chapter in that journey — from backend developer to senior DevOps engineer, delivering real-world impact at companies like **HCL**, **Hexad**, and **Perfood**.
