## Lead DevOps Engineer

At Hexad GmbH, I played a key role in designing, building, and maintaining scalable, secure DevOps platforms for multiple client-facing applications. As the Lead DevOps Engineer, I led the DevOps transformation efforts within cross-functional teams, aligning infrastructure automation with agile delivery processes.

I was responsible for architecting and implementing CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI, enabling faster and more reliable delivery cycles across development, staging, and production environments. My expertise in Terraform, Helm, and Kubernetes (EKS) allowed us to standardize infrastructure provisioning and application deployments across projects, significantly reducing configuration drift and manual errors.

One of my most impactful contributions was leading the adoption of GitOps with ArgoCD, which enhanced deployment visibility, rollback capabilities, and auditability for both internal and external stakeholders. I also implemented centralized monitoring and observability stacks using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and ELK, providing real-time insight into system health and application performance.

Additionally, I established best practices for cloud security and cost optimization on AWS, and mentored DevOps engineers on infrastructure-as-code, secrets management (Vault), and production incident handling. This role solidified my expertise in building developer-centric, resilient platforms and helped position Hexad as a DevOps-driven organization.
