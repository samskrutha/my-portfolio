## Senior DevOps Engineer

At Perfood GmbH, I led the development of a robust, production-grade Kubernetes platform on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to support our digital health products. I designed and implemented GitOps-driven infrastructure using ArgoCD, empowering teams to deploy confidently with consistency and traceability.

My work focused on infrastructure automation using **Terraform** and **Crossplane**, secure secret management with **Vault**, and observability through a fully integrated stack: **Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Thanos**. I also architected automated backup strategies using Kubernetes cron jobs and GCS buckets, ensuring resilience and recoverability for both PostgreSQL and application data.

One of my key achievements was migrating our analytics platform (**Matomo**) into Kubernetes, improving scalability, database security, and backup automation. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to define **SLOs**, implement proactive alerting, and streamline deployment pipelines in **GitLab CI/CD**.

This role deepened my experience in building developer-centric cloud platforms in regulated environments, and strengthened my expertise in GCP-native DevOps and platform engineering.
