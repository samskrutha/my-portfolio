I never planned to become a DevOps engineer.

In fact, I started my career over a decade ago as a **backend developer**, building APIs and systems for U.S. clients. I spent six years immersed in clean code, business logic, and scaling server-side applications. But as time passed, I realized that writing code was only part of building reliable software — the real magic (and sometimes the chaos) happened after deployment.

That's when I made the shift.

## 💡 What Pulled Me into DevOps?

Around five years ago, I found myself constantly stepping in to troubleshoot CI failures, misconfigured servers, and release rollbacks. I realized that **developer efficiency, observability, and infrastructure automation** were areas I naturally gravitated toward.

So I leaned in.

I learned tools like **Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, GitLab CI/CD, Prometheus, Grafana, AWS, and Crossplane**. What started as a side responsibility eventually became a full transition into DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).

## 🔧 What I've Built So Far

- Set up **GitLab CI/CD pipelines** that automatically build, test, and deploy microservices to Kubernetes clusters.
- Used **ArgoCD and GitOps** principles to manage app lifecycles across staging and production environments.
- Implemented **ELK and Prometheus/Grafana** stacks for observability and proactive monitoring.
- Migrated infrastructure from manual provisioning to **Terraform-as-code**, making environments reproducible and consistent.
- Introduced **Crossplane** for dynamic provisioning of AWS resources using Kubernetes-native workflows.

Each of these projects taught me one big lesson: **automation is not about writing scripts — it's about building trust in systems**.

## ⚠️ The Hard Lessons

This journey wasn’t smooth. I’ve:

- Debugged broken Helm deployments under pressure
- Misconfigured resource limits that caused outages
- Accidentally triggered large-scale restarts through a faulty GitLab pipeline
- Dealt with legacy systems with no documentation

But every failure refined my approach. DevOps isn’t about perfection — it’s about continuous **learning, recovery, and resilience**.

## 🌱 Where I'm Headed Next

Right now, I’m focused on:

- Deepening my expertise in **Kubernetes security and cost optimization**
- Writing infrastructure design documents and **improving developer onboarding**
- Exploring **OpenTelemetry** and **Crossplane Providers** written in Go
- Sharing more of what I’ve learned with the community (starting with this blog!)

I’m also actively looking for **a new role** where I can help teams build **reliable, scalable, and observable systems**, while staying deeply aligned with DevOps best practices.

## 🙏 Why I’m Starting This Blog

I want to document and share:
- Real-world DevOps problems and how I solve them
- Lessons from working across different tools and teams
- Personal reflections as I grow as a platform/SRE engineer

If you're a developer transitioning into DevOps, a fellow SRE, or someone navigating tech career shifts — I hope this space gives you insight, reassurance, or even a helpful tip.

Let’s learn together.
