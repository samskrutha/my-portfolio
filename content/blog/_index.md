Welcome to my blog — a space where I share insights from real-world DevOps experiences, cloud infrastructure challenges, and lessons learned while building secure, scalable systems.

Here you’ll find posts on topics like Kubernetes, GitOps, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, and cloud-native architecture — along with reflections on productivity, personal growth, and the spiritual side of working in tech.

Every article is written with the goal of clarity, depth, and usefulness — whether you’re a fellow engineer, a team lead, or someone just starting out in DevOps.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any topic further.
