[{"categories":null,"contents":"I never planned to become a DevOps engineer.\nIn fact, I started my career over a decade ago as a backend developer, building APIs and systems for U.S. clients. I spent six years immersed in clean code, business logic, and scaling server-side applications. But as time passed, I realized that writing code was only part of building reliable software ‚Äî the real magic (and sometimes the chaos) happened after deployment.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I made the shift.\nüí° What Pulled Me into DevOps? Around five years ago, I found myself constantly stepping in to troubleshoot CI failures, misconfigured servers, and release rollbacks. I realized that developer efficiency, observability, and infrastructure automation were areas I naturally gravitated toward.\nSo I leaned in.\nI learned tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, GitLab CI/CD, Prometheus, Grafana, AWS, and Crossplane. What started as a side responsibility eventually became a full transition into DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).\nüîß What I\u0026rsquo;ve Built So Far Set up GitLab CI/CD pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy microservices to Kubernetes clusters. Used ArgoCD and GitOps principles to manage app lifecycles across staging and production environments. Implemented ELK and Prometheus/Grafana stacks for observability and proactive monitoring. Migrated infrastructure from manual provisioning to Terraform-as-code, making environments reproducible and consistent. Introduced Crossplane for dynamic provisioning of AWS resources using Kubernetes-native workflows. Each of these projects taught me one big lesson: automation is not about writing scripts ‚Äî it\u0026rsquo;s about building trust in systems.\n‚ö†Ô∏è The Hard Lessons This journey wasn‚Äôt smooth. I‚Äôve:\nDebugged broken Helm deployments under pressure Misconfigured resource limits that caused outages Accidentally triggered large-scale restarts through a faulty GitLab pipeline Dealt with legacy systems with no documentation But every failure refined my approach. DevOps isn‚Äôt about perfection ‚Äî it‚Äôs about continuous learning, recovery, and resilience.\nüå± Where I\u0026rsquo;m Headed Next Right now, I‚Äôm focused on:\nDeepening my expertise in Kubernetes security and cost optimization Writing infrastructure design documents and improving developer onboarding Exploring OpenTelemetry and Crossplane Providers written in Go Sharing more of what I‚Äôve learned with the community (starting with this blog!) I‚Äôm also actively looking for a new role where I can help teams build reliable, scalable, and observable systems, while staying deeply aligned with DevOps best practices.\nüôè Why I‚Äôm Starting This Blog I want to document and share:\nReal-world DevOps problems and how I solve them Lessons from working across different tools and teams Personal reflections as I grow as a platform/SRE engineer If you\u0026rsquo;re a developer transitioning into DevOps, a fellow SRE, or someone navigating tech career shifts ‚Äî I hope this space gives you insight, reassurance, or even a helpful tip.\nLet‚Äôs learn together.\nSamskrutha Swamy\nDevOps | SRE | Kubernetes Enthusiast\nüìç Berlin, Germany\nüí¨ Let me know what topics you\u0026rsquo;d like to read about next.
